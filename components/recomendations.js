  full: "I had the privilege of working directly with Pedro for almost 2 years on development of a large web application for a major client. The application itself consisted of a React/Nextjs front end hosted in AWS and connecting to a GraphQL middleware that consolidated numerous API's to provide the front end with consistent and sticked together data. \n Pedro started working with us mainly on the front end application side but very quickly learned and mastered the back end service as well becoming an integral member of our team and consistently turning out strong and consistent code that hus to set the standard for other team members as well as the project as a whole. His attention to detail, understanding and communication were so strong that he quickly set a standard for even our senior developers to follow./n It isn't just his individual contributions to the project however, Pedro consistently exhibited a work ethic that sets him apart from other team members. Going above and beyond to understand the minutia of the project as well as taking a holistic view of the project as a whole. His attitude was always 'How can I improve this' adding his knowledge or understanding to pieces of the project that helped them work in sync with the back end data as well as with other portions of the site./n I would recommend Pedro for any project I was working on, his work, his leadership and his overall attitude make him an ideal contributor and just a great person to have on your team. Thank you Pedro for all your effort, you are a true rockstar!",
